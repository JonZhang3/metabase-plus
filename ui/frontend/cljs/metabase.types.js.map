metabase.types\n  \"The Metabase Hierarchical Type System (MHTS). This is a hierarchy where types derive from one or more parent types,\n  which in turn derive from their own parents. This makes it possible to add new types without needing to add\n  corresponding mappings in the frontend or other places. For example, a Database may want a type called something\n  like `:type/CaseInsensitiveText`; we can add this type as a derivative of `:type/Text` and everywhere else can\n  continue to treat it as such until further notice.\n\n  There are a few different keyword hierarchies below:\n\n  ### Data (Base/Effective) Types -- keys starting with `:type/` and deriving from `:type/*`, but not `:Semantic/*` or `:Relation/*`\n\n  The 'base type' represents the actual data type of the column in the data warehouse. The 'effective type' is the\n  data type we treat this column as; it may be the same as base type or something different if the column has a\n  coercion strategy (see below). Example: a `VARCHAR` column might have a base type of `:type/Text`, but store\n  ISO-8601 timestamps; we might choose to interpret this column as a timestamp column by giving it an effective type\n  of `:type/DateTime` and the coercion strategy `:Coercion/ISO8601->DateTime`\n\n  ### Coercion Strategies -- keys starting with `:Coercion/`\n\n  These strategies tell us how to coerce a column from its base type to it effective type when the two differ. For\n  example, `:Coercion/ISO8601->DateTime` can be used to tell us how to interpret a `VARCHAR` column (base type =\n  `:type/Text`) as a `:type/DateTime` column (effective type). This depends of the database, but we might do something\n  like using a `parse_timestamp()` function whenever we fetch this column.\n\n  ### Semantic Types -- types starting with `:type/*` and deriving from `:Semantic/*`\n\n  NOTE: In the near future we plan to rename the semantic types so they start with `:Semantic/` rather than `:type/`.\n\n  These types represent the semantic meaning/interpretation/purpose of a column in the data warehouse, for example\n  `:type/UpdatedTimestamp`. This affects things like how we display this column or how we generate Automagic\n  Dashboards. How is this different from Base/Effective type? Suppose we have an `updated_at` `TIMESTAMP` column; its\n  data type is `TIMESTAMP` and thus its base type would be `:type/DateTime`. There is no such thing as an\n  `UPDATED_AT_TIMESTAMP` data type; the fact that this column is used to record update timestamps is purely a semantic\n  one.\n\n  :Semantic types descend from data type(s) that are allowed to have this semantic type. For example,\n  `:type/UpdatedTimestamp` descends from `:type/DateTime`, which means a column with an effective type of\n  `:type/DateTime` can have a semantic type of`:type/UpdatedTimestamp`; however a `:type/Boolean` cannot -- this\n  would make no sense. (Unless maybe `false` meant `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` and `true` meant `1970-01-01T00:00:01Z`, but\n  I think we can agree that's dumb.)\n\n  ### Relation Type -- types starting with `:type/*` and deriving from `:Relation/*`\n\n  NOTE: As with Semantic types, in the near future we'll change the relation types so they all start with `:Relation/`.\n\n  Types that have to do with whether this column is a primary key or foreign key. These are currently stored in the\n  `semantic_type` column, but we'll split them out into a separate `relation_type` column in the future.\n\n  ### Entity Types -- keys starting with `:entity/`\n\n  These are used to record the semantic purpose of a Table.\"\n  #?@(:clj\n      [(:require\n        [clojure.set :as set]\n        [metabase.types.coercion-hierarchies :as coercion-hierarchies])]\n      :cljs\n      [(:require\n        [clojure.set :as set]\n        [metabase.shared.util :as shared.u]\n        [metabase.types.coercion-hierarchies :as coercion-hierarchies])]))\n\n;;; Table (entity) Types\n\n(derive :entity/GenericTable :entity/*)\n(derive :entity/UserTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/CompanyTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/TransactionTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/ProductTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/SubscriptionTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/EventTable :entity/GenericTable)\n(derive :entity/GoogleAnalyticsTable :entity/GenericTable)\n\n\n;;; Numeric Types\n\n(derive :type/Number :type/*)\n\n(derive :type/Integer :type/Number)\n(derive :type/BigInteger :type/Integer)\n\n(derive :type/Quantity :Semantic/*)\n(derive :type/Quantity :type/Integer)\n\n;; `:type/Float` means any number with a decimal place!
