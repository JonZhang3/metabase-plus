These clauses are automatically rewritten as simpler clauses by the `desugar` or `expand-macros`\n;;    middleware. Thus driver implementations do not need to handle these clauses.\n;;\n;; *  Clauses marked `^:internal` are automatically generated by `wrap-value-literals` or other middleware from values\n;;    passed in. They are not intended to be used by the frontend when generating a query. These add certain\n;;    information that simplify driver implementations. When writing MBQL queries yourself you should pretend these\n;;    clauses don't exist.\n;;\n;; *  Clauses marked `^{:requires-features #{feature+}}` require a certain set of features to be used. At some date in\n;;    the future we will likely add middleware that uses this metadata to automatically validate that a driver has the\n;;    features needed to run the query in question.\n\n;;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n;;; |                                                  MBQL Clauses                                                  |\n;;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n;;; ------------------------------------------------- Datetime Stuff -------------------------------------------------\n\n(def date-bucketing-units\n  \"Set of valid units for bucketing or comparing against a *date* Field.\"\n  #{:default :day :day-of-week :day-of-month :day-of-year :week :week-of-year\n    :month :month-of-year :quarter :quarter-of-year :year})\n\n(def time-bucketing-units\n  \"Set of valid units for bucketing or comparing against a *time* Field.\"\n  #{:default :millisecond :second :minute :minute-of-hour :hour :hour-of-day})\n\n(def datetime-bucketing-units\n  \"Set of valid units for bucketing or comparing against a *datetime* Field.\"\n  (set/union date-bucketing-units time-bucketing-units))\n\n(def DateUnit\n  \"Valid unit for *date* bucketing.\"\n  (s/named\n   (apply s/enum date-bucketing-units)\n   \"date-bucketing-unit\"))\n\n;; it could make sense to say hour-of-day(field) =  hour-of-day(\"2018-10-10T12:00\")\n;; but it does not make sense to say month-of-year(field) = month-of-year(\"08:00:00\"),\n;; does it?
